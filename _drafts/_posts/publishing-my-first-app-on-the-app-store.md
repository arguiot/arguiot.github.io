Publishing an app on world's most famous app downloader is not an easy task. Here is how did.

# Step 1. The App

I started developing the app for the CrypTools organization since April 13. It's about <span class="ago">April 13 2018</span>. I followed some courses on Swift development, and I started right after.

# Step 2. Getting the Apple developer program

I had some trouble buying it because I bought it on an Australian account, but the credit card was registered in Hong Kong because I live there now.

I contacted Apple, but they was pretty busy, and they could only answer after 1 week. (I understand, I ordered it a few days before the WWDC).

But I finally got it, and I'm so happy to have iOS 12 before everyone üòù.

# Step 3. Preparing the app

Once I've done everything, I had to prepare the app, and all the different assets. This wasn't an easy task.
