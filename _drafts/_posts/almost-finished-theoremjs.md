TheoremJS is almost finished, and the v1.0 should come in the next weeks or month, so here is a little recap of what is TheoremJS, and how close we are from the final release.

# What is TheoremJS??

_TheoremJS' website_

TheoremJS is library for math and computation in JavaScript. Basically, you could compare it to NumPy or SymPy. It has dozens of functions that will help you explore the beautiful universe that is mathematics.

**You can go checkout the** [**website**](https://theorem.js.org) **for more informations**

I started to work on Theorem since November in 2017, it's about <span class="ago">23 Nov 2017</span>, and I learned a lot of things about math and computer science.

TheoremJS should be released in about  2 or 3 weeks, so I can fix errors, and add new cool functions ðŸ˜Ž.
