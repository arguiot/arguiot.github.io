_Yes, TheoremJS is finally here!_

# Huge work for an amazing product

If I had to choose my biggest GitHub project, it would probably be that one. It took months to realize. I usually code small things that takes 2 or 3 weeks to develop.

TheoremJS is an amazing library ðŸ“š, it can do so many things. It's like a Swiss army knife: it doesn't focus on one thing but on many.

Everything I learned in the past in terms of project management and development is in TheoremJS.

## ... And it's not finished

I'll continue to add new features to TheoremJS, and I'll continue resolving issues because I believe that good projects deserve support.
