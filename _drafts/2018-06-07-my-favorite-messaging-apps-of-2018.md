When it comes to messaging / chatting you have a lot of messaging apps out there. Here are my favorite.

# 1. Discord

Discord is awesome ðŸ˜Ž, there is tons of features and is the best messaging app for teams, group or gamers. I've been using it in every of these cases, and it clearly crushed it.

# 2. iMessage

It might seems a little bit weird to choose iMessage, because it's the native messaging app of any Apple devices, but iMessage is really an amazing apps. There is very cool stuff such as apps, effects and **Animojis** ðŸ¤©.
