When it comes to messaging / chatting you have a lot of messaging apps out there. Here are my favorite.

# 1. Discord

Discord is awesome ðŸ˜Ž, there is tons of features and is the best messaging app for teams, group or gamers. I've been using it in every of these cases, and it clearly crushed it.

# 2. iMessage

It might seems a little bit weird to choose iMessage, because it's the native messaging app of any Apple devices, but iMessage is really an amazing apps. There is very cool stuff such as apps, effects and **Animojis** ðŸ¤©.

_Also, because a lot of people have an iPhone, you can. use it with a lot of people_

# 3. Twitter

Twitter's direct messages might seem a little bit 'under featured', but it really is a good messaging app. Firstly because it supports fun stuff such as GIFs and Stickers. And secondly because it is simple. You don't need to have something complex that have tons of features, just something simple and easy to use.

_The end._
