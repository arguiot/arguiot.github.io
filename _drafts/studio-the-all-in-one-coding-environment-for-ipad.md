_I've been working on a pretty cool app called StudIO that aims to provide iPad users a fully functional coding environment without compromises._

StudIO is an iOS app that simulates the same complete development environment that you have on macOS or Ubuntu (or other *nix OS) machine. It primarily focuses on iPad, but it does work perfectly fine on any iPhone.
