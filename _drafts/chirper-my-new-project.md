_Chirper is a menu bar app for macOS to tweet or buffer for thoughts_

# Why this project?

I created this project in order to tackle one of my problem: tweet something without leaving the app I'm using.

For example, when I watch the FIFA World Cup of my computer, I don't want to leave the live stream.
