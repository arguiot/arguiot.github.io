Today, I'm releasing [ProType](https://protype.js.org), a new kind of JavaScript MVC framework that uses class to help developers building the next big thing.

## What is exactly ProType?

ProType is JavaScript front end (browser) framework. It is object oriented only and help you separate tasks and views while staying productive.

## Why ProType?

Because I couldn't find a framework that could use classes in the most effective way. I wanted something that could resemble other language, such as Swift (and Cocoa) or Dart (with Flutter). ProType will help you build big UIs, such as web apps or apps with other frameworks like Cordova or Electron.Â   
  
_P.S. The word ProType comes from Prototype, a property used in JavaScript to add elements to a class_

# Give it a try
